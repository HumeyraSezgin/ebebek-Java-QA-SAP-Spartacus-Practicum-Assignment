## Armstrong Number

What is Armstrong Number?
An n-digit number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the nth powers of the digits is equal to the number itself.

Take the number 407, for example. (4^3)+ (0^3)+(7^3) = 64+0+343 = 407. This shows that the number 407 is an armstrong number.

Let's also look at the number 1342. (1^4)+(3^4)+(4^4)+(2^4) =1+81+256+16=354 is not an armstrong number because it is not equal to 1342.
